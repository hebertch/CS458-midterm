TEACHING LITERACY TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS IN THE BORDERLANDS A CASE STUDY OF A SIXTH GRADE LANGUAGE ARTS AND READING TEACHER A n n M a r ie S m ith Y o la n d a S a lg a d o University of Texas of the Permian Basin The purpose of this case study was to investigate how an English language arts teacher used young adult literature to help English language learners improve English and literacy comprehension Through the lens of Anzalduas borderlands and RolonDows critical care the authors analyze the case study teachers methods for helping her students comprehend texts more effectively while negotiating the schools Englishonly boundaries Teachers can expect to have English language learners in their classrooms and many may not feel prepared to help ELL students meet the academic demands of school Fu HansomThomas Cavagnetto The percentage of public school students in the United States who were ELLs in was percent or an estimated million students In the state of Texas the location of this study the percentage of ELLs was percent in ncesed proeramscoeindicator cgfasp Along with academic instruction teachers support students emotional and intellectual identities as they negotiate the boundaries and challenges of literacy learning in public schools which may emphasize English over first languages often to the detriment of students Garcia Gomez Freeman Freeman In spite of teachers best intentions public schools may place restrictions on teachers who desire to help their students learn English while developing their native languages and cultures Calderon Saldivar Fredericks Moll Ruiz Showstack Valenzuela Research on teaching methods and bilingual programs is extant however in depth study of bilingual teachers negotiations of school boundaries and students language needs is limited Linton has shown that there is a positive relationship between upward mobility and bilingualism especially for US Latinos Students may grapple with retaining their language and cultures yet they are expected to learn English to become successful in school and workplaces English language learners who live near the TexasMexico border such as the students in our study must adapt to contradictions in language and culture as they attend school in the US and speak Spanish at home The intention of this study is to add to the field of literacy and English language learners because it includes a close examination of a successful ELL sixth grade teacher who uses young adult literature YAL to engage ELLs In this case study school ELLs are required to transition to English only classes after grade In schools where English fluency is valued Reading Improvement over home or second languages ELL teachers may need to push against school policies that inhibit them from helping students become bilingual Garcia Purpose of Study Our study analyzes the methods a Latina bilingual teacher uses to teach language arts to middle school students in a school geographically located near the TexasMexico border This study also demonstrates the problems and possibilities experienced by an ELL teacher who must consider how to best support students in a year of transition from ELLsupported instruction to English only The following research questions guide this study How does the teacher use young adult literature to teach ELLs How does the teacher support her students in learning English while improving overall literacy skills Through the lens of Anzalduas borderlands and RolonDows critical care discussed in the next section our study explores the methods of a sixth grade ELL and language arts teacher Theoretical Framework In schools with rapidly growing ELL populations teachers are encouraged by researchers to incorporate high interest young adult literature along with teaching strategies for improving literacy and English language skills AngayCrowder Choi Yi Fredericks In addition to the engagement perspective we ground our research in Anzalduas theory of borderlands and the toll it takes on young recent immigrants to the US Anzalduas work is discussed first as it applies to our interpretation of the emotional and literacy struggles teachers and students experience in the borderlands of TexasMexicofollowing the discussion on borderlands we discuss RolonDows theory of critical care which combines critical theory with an ethic of care Borderlands and the new mestizoa Anzalduas writings on borderlands and the new mestizoa have influenced researchers and teachers of immigrants and ELLs as they consider the psychological and cultural struggles students experience in public schools as new immigrants andor English language learners Borderlands is used figuratively in this article to refer to cultural ambiguities and also literally to refer to the geographical border that divides Texas and Mexico Anzaldua Some of these borders become boundaries for students who must negotiate their identities and compete with the academic power of native English speakers in the US To help ELL students push beyond linguistic and social boundaries scholars and practitioners have looked for teaching methods that empower Students cannot reach their full academic potential if they are limited by teaching strategies that do not engage and improve literacy and language knowledge For example Fitts describes bilingual classrooms in which the teachers challenged an ideology of inequality by pairing fluent speakers of English with fluent speakers of Spanish in order to provide effective models of both languages Schools themselves may also unknowingly produce barriers for ELL students Manyak critiques sources of power in schools and politics that impede effective dual language instruction specifically as a result of the California Proposition Instead of intense English immersion only the teacher in Manyaks study worked against school district barriers by creating a classroom climate where students spoke informal and formal Spanish and English depending on what would benefit the students according to their literacy and language backgrounds Garcia Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands Anzaldua refers to herself and others who experience multiple languages and cultures as mestizoa Mestizo refers to Mexican people of mixed descent Mexican and Indian Anazladua takes this term further using mestizoa to refer to US citizens of Mexican descent as well as people who place themselves in categories that seem contradictory such as MexicanUS Texan ProtestantCatholic gayheterosexual etc Mestioas also work with multiple languages and dialectsâ€”Spanish English Tex Mex Spanglish etc Identity constructions depend on developing a whole perspective one that includes rather than excludes Anzaldua p Tofunction individuals come to define who they are in their local context formulating identity narratives that link their past and present to a desire future a future many will fall short of reaching The complexities of the two worlds students navigate to and from are unique to each individual Some ELLs come to escape wars others ethnic conflicts andor gang violence while others simply tofind a better life Bowie and Daviss miniseries Unsettled Journ ey followed immigrant teens for month to see what happens once they reach the United States Some Ells will have little to no schooling and others may have spent years in refugee camps Yet all must learn English when entering the US and tackle academic work on an unforgiving timeline Many will falter Some will show remarkable resilience receiving social validations that bring forth assurance and fortifies their emergent identities The result of these dynamics is a visceral understanding of self or who they are in the local context that helps facilitate adjustment US ELL and bilingual students identify within a combination of races cultures languages and dialects Public schools are continually adapting to changes in demographics as a result schools may not make the best decisions on how to help ELLs to become successful academically Valenzuela found that criticisms and negative attitudes toward speakers of other languages influence ELL students language identities complicating English language acquisition for some students Often it is this growing population of English language learners that does not get the educational services they need to thrive within and beyond school The quality of instruction they receive diminishes when teachers perceptions communicate low expectations however finding effective ways to teach ELLs should be the job of all teachers Zamel Participants in Batt cited the lack of understanding of diversity or multicultural education as one of their challenges faced in educating ELLs Students and preservice professional teachers we work with near the TexasMexico border identify with a variety of cultural backgrounds For example many teachers and their students are Mexican immigrants or descendants of Mexican immigrants but may not speak Spanish as a first or even second language The few teachers who are bilingual SpanishEnglish are in high demand in the local schools and are often responsible for bringing students up to English proficiency standards Their Mexican heritage and Spanish language is a source of pride for Latinoa preservice and professional teachers which they share with their students Valenzuela Researchers have explored how geographic cultural and language borders affect identities literacy politics socialization and education Anzaldua Bejar Calderon Saldivar Hicks Rosaido Saldivar Skerrett In the US students who exist in the borderlands of the US and Mexico must develop coping skills in learning English At the same time these English language learners are developing academic and cultural identities and adapting to the structure of schooling in the US Martinez Musetti Salas Perez Reading Improvement Valenzuela Teachers who criticize students first languages and Mexican dialects ignore the potential of students to become fluent and literate in English and Spanish Pennycook Showstack This possibility for critique with students and teachers and how critical care can engage teachers and ELL students is discussed in the next section Critical care and English Language Learners RolonDow uses the phrase critical care to describe the belief that many teachers demonstrate care for their students as human beings with unique identities as well as academic students Critical care involves teaching students to respect personal identities of themselves and others at the same time students are taught to critique positions of power that may limit their academic success RolonDow suggests that learners perceptions of individual power in the classroom can affect their goals and motivation to improve literacy comprehension He Vetter Fairbanks Jang Jimenez Stevens Effective teachers of ELL students realize the importance of creating a culture of critical care in which students and teachers critique policies and cultural constructions that serve to impair the academic success of students ArnotHopffer Moll These critiques occur in classroom activities such as literature discussions political conversations and questioning Cultivated by their teachers students need to perceive a climate in which they have an authentic voice Valenzuela The social construction of Mexican people as illegal or undocumented may affect students willingness to participate actively in school and may inhibit parents desire to meet with their childrens teachers or participate in school activities Musetti Salas Perez Nunez Family and culture are important for students learning English as a second language and students should be taught to use what they already know about language to promote new learning Freeman Freeman Nieto Considering family and culture in the classroom reflects teachers ethic of care Schooling that builds on the resources of students and their communities in doing academic work has been successful in helping teachers approach their schools community and funds of knowledge Moll and Gonzalez Mercado and Moll Readers responses to literature are products of the readers themselves as individual thinkers and cultural participants When ELLs read texts in which they see characters like themselves they not only stay motivated to read but alsofind empowerment in literature Sullivan It is important that all ELL students are provided opportunities to participate actively in literacy activities especially if they are mainstreamed with native English speakers Teachers need to know their students and be sensitive to their learning needs treat them as intellectuals and encourage them to share their opinions Yoon Schander Blama and Massa recommend motivating ELL students to improve reading comprehension through literature art and music Through explorative activities in a variety of media students are motivated to learn language and comprehend texts Language development is enhanced when students learn how to critically analyze texts Fluang This motivation is additionally fueled when students connect their personal lives to the texts through reading discussions and other activities How ELL teachers draw on the experiences of students border cultures and identities has not been studied in depth We suggest that successful ELL teachers develop a sensitivity to students cultural and language identity through critical care AntonOldenburg Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands Garza Garza et al Gilligan I Noddings I I Perez Valenzuela Garza et al determined that getting to know students personally while supporting emotional cultural and academic needs most closely described teachers definitions of care for their students There is also a need to empower students to interrogate conditions in society that may limit their selfperception as students of language arts and literacy which is the critical piece of critical care Teachers can encourage students to examine how beliefs about race and class inform ideologies inherent in systems of power including hidden curricula in public schools RolonDow Teachers who demonstrate care through a critical lens are able to develop authentic relationships pedagogical practices and institutional structures that benefit Latino students RolonDow p Our work with Ms Martinez pseudonym reminds us that the daily work of teaching literacy cannot be accomplished without compassion and care for students their cultures and languages RolonDow Stewart Through the lens of Anzalduas borderlands and RolonDows critical care we explore the ways an ELL teacher worked within the confines of school policies to build her students English literacy and language capitalizing on the strengths of their Spanish language skills In our case study class students read and discussed YAL while exploring the metaphorical and literal borderlands of identities culture and language Methodology School setting and participants Central Elementary School pseudonym is located in a city in West Texas and includes grades kindergarten through sixth grade A Title I school consisting of predominantly English language learners the school population includes Latinoa native Texans and Mexican immigrants Elementary schools in the area are overcrowded due to the oil boom Within the last ten years an increasing number of families have arrived in this area to work in the oil business Many of these families emigrated from Mexico or are relatives of Mexicanbom immigrants Some of these families are bilingual some are native English speakers and some speak Spanish only Administrators at Central Elementary expressed concerns about state test scores because the school was labeled as needs improvement by the state As a result reading comprehension strategies were emphasized along with test preparation skills in sixth grade Mrs Martinez was responsible for teaching ELL sixth grade mathematics and reading Although instruction was primarily in English Mrs Martinez occasionally translated words and phrases into Spanish and provided explanation in Spanish She encouraged students to ask questions in Spanish with the goal of moving them toward English only by seventh grade which was a stated school district requirement ELLs could expect little support in their first language by seventh grade Fluent in English and Spanish Ms Martinez has a Masters Degree in Spanish She is a native of Texas and her family is originally from Mexico A certified elementary and bilingual teacher she has been teaching in public schools for approximately twenty years Her sixth grade class consisted of twentythree students Nineteen of these students were second language English speakers with Spanish as their primary language Case Study Methods Because we sought to study the teacher and students lived experiences case study methods were deemed appropriate Merriam Case studies are investigations of bounded systems Smith Reading Improvement Within the boundary of Mrs Martinezs sixth grade classroom we focus on Ms Martinezs perceptions of her class as well as the researchers understanding of how the institution of school informs Mrs Martinez work with her students After speaking with the school principal about our study she recommended Mrs Martinez as an experienced and exceptional language arts and ELL teacher The first author met with Mrs Martinez and she agreed to allow the first author to enter her classroom to observe how she used YAL to teach students literacy and language Data Collection The following research questions mentioned previously in the purpose section guided the data collection How does the teacher use young adult literature to teach ELLs How does the teacher support her students in learning English while improving overall literacy skills Mrs Martinez was interviewed formally once at the beginning of the study and once at the end of the study after one school year These interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed The first author observed Mrs Martinez teaching sixth grade literacy and language arts for hours twice a week throughout the school year for a total of seven months Observation notes focused on students oral responses to YAL in class discussions as well as Mrs Martinez instructional methods for teaching literacy and English Researchers were especially interested in Mrs Martinez methods for using both English and instruction in discussing YAL so observation notes contained descriptions of teaching methods as well as Mrs Martinez and the students verbal responses in both English and Spanish Validity Triangulation of data contributed to the validity of this study Merriam Along with the observation notes and interview transcripts the researcher asked Mrs Martinez followup questions about observation notes to clarify the purposes of instruction Member checking with Mrs Martinez occurred throughout the data collection and analysis Creswell Mrs Martinez was generous with her feedback and explanations of instruction Second the first author made notes of the variety of roles performed in the classroom to create a clear picture of the research setting and process Finally themes that were developed during data analysis were discussed with the second author who is bilingual SpanishEnglish and is a professor of bilingual education Researcher Roles During a nineweek time frame during spring semester the first authors observation role changed to that of participantobserver Spradley The schools administrators were concerned about the students low scores on nineweek tests so teachers were asked tofocus on reading comprehension and math skills in preparation for the state tests The first author volunteered to work with students in small groups on reading comprehension to assist the teacher Mrs Martinez This period of tutoring students in small groups occurred for approximately nine weeks during the spring semester During the reading tutoring sessions Mrs Martinez tutored students in math so the researcher focused her observations on the students she was working with in the reading groups After the nine weeks concluded the researcher again focused on observing Mrs Martinez and the whole class as Mrs Martinez returned to teaching literacy with YAL Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands Data Analysis Data analysis went through several phases beginning with the first author In order to address the research questions the first author pulled sections from observation notes that directly reflected the teaching of language and literacy through YAL These notes were typed and sent to the second author Also the first author interviewed Ms Martinez about why she uses YAL first question For the second question Ms Martinez was asked about activities and events in the classroom observed by the first author The transcriptions of the twoformal recorded interviews were then sent to the second author for review after the school year ended Throughout the school year the first author conversed with Ms Martinez periodically about classroom activities and administrator decisions affecting ELLs These conversations were added to the observation notes Open Coding Each author first coded transcripts and observation notes separately by writing invivo codes words and phrases spoken by the participants in the margins of the transcripts Corbin Strauss The second author a native Spanish speaker and bilingual education professor checked Spanish language notations written by the first author correcting any errors in the first authors notes After conversations about the opencoded notes and interview transcripts the authors discussed possible themes that synthesized the data Corbin Strauss and responded to the research questions The authors conversations about coding led to the following themes which are explained and analyzed in the findings section English Language Differentiation Visualization and Reading Comprehension Crossing Boundaries with Cuentos and Cultural Contradictions in School Borderlands Findings Findings reflect the authors understandings of the ways Mrs Martinez viewed her teaching expertise within the confines of school boundaries Connecting with her students home lives andor experiences as new immigrants Mrs Martinez considered her students individual language and literacy needs and cultural experiences Next we highlight the themes that the authors believe best describes the work of Mrs Martinez and her students Theme English language differentiation In responding to question Why does the teacher use YA literature to teach English language learners our observations of Mrs Martinez suggested that her primary goal was for students to be active readers writers and speakers in English In moments when students struggled with English she encouraged students to communicate in Spanish Understanding that each student arrived to her classroom with unique skills and backgrounds Mrs Martinez applied her knowledge of how students acquire a new language by incorporating a variety of language instructional strategies Fluent in Spanish and English Mrs Martinez read aloud and discussed literature in English If a student seemed confused or if she wanted to give explicit instructions she would explain in Spanish Mrs Martinez occasionally translated English to Spanish in order to provide a bridge for those students who may have lacked the understanding or connections to academic language in English One example of EnglishSpanish instruction occurred when the class was reading the book The Cay Mrs Martinez asked What does the word rancid mean Its a cognate One student said rancio Students provided various definitions for the word rancio rancid Pointing out and rehearsing cognates is an effective teaching strategy for ELLs Reading Improvement Escamilla When I asked Mrs Martinez why she occasionally used Spanish she explained I had one student who was a first year immigrant student and hes like I dont read in English And I said Well do you read in Spanish and he said yes Well than you can read in English I introduce them to cognates and now he does it I say read it to me and hell read in Spanishâ€”however he can sound it out then he can translate it and say Hey I know what that says The students learned language acquisition skills and they appeared comfortable practicing reading speaking and writing English when Mrs Martinez discussed cognates and pointed out the similarities and differences between Spanish and English Use of metalanguageâ€”talking about language its structures in between and across languagesâ€”is helpful to English language learners working toward bilingualism Escamilla A cognate that incited a critical discussion on the novel The Cay was the word Negro which Mrs Martinez explained was how white people historically referred to Black people Mrs Martinez compared Negro with MexicanAmerican Then a student asked Were white people better Mrs Martinez replied They thought they were At this point in the class Mrs Martinez stopped reading aloud and asked students to write higher level questions in their journals Modeling higher level questioning Mrs Martinez said You have to use your own personal connections like when we talked about why we thought Phillip was a troublemaker What is the racism in the book Why did Phillip get slapped in the face by Timothy Mrs Martinez called on students to use their knowledge of English and Spanish vocabulary while drawing on understandings of racism Believing her students were capable of higher levels of analysis Mrs Martinez did not limit discussions to literal comprehension Yoon The following day Mrs Martinez explained that students were beginning to design higherlevel questions and think more deeply about the novel A social justice vision of education must include critical questioning Grant p Grant citing Freire explains that questioning provides power to those who question and refuse to accept answers without analysis and research Mrs Martinez pushed students to critique texts and think beyond literal levels modeling then requiring students to write their own openended questions Along with all learners ELLs need practice understanding that not every question has a rightwrong answer Escamilla In Ms Martinezs class students were encouraged to ask questions in English or Spanish to acquire necessary information however students usually wrote in English only often with individual assistance from Mrs Martinez Flexible multiplicity occurs in Mrs Martinezs classroom as students speak both Spanish and English depending on necessity and context Garcia Mrs Martinez modeled the importance of bilingualism in her presentation of content Students were also requested to ask peers for help Ask three before me Mrs Martinez instructed the class This taught students interdependence as they worked with their peers on language and literacy Mrs Martinez demonstrated an ethic of care as she responded to the language and learning needs of the students Garza et ak Noddings Through her methods of teaching cognates and inviting students to ask questions in both Spanish and English she nurtured students in their learning of English while teaching the value of retaining students first language Martinez Valenzuela Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands These teaching methods provide an environment conducive to learning at the same time students are motivated and empowered to improve academically Theme Visualization and reading comprehension Research question How does the teacher support her students in learning English while improving literacy skills encouraged us to examine both the observation notes and the interviews with Mrs Martinez Her classroom practices seemed to suggest her belief in the importance of using YAL to teach visualization strategies Visualization can be used as a tool for improving literacy comprehension and language skills Brinda Naughton Palmer et al Park Rozansky Aagesen Mrs Martinez valued visualization as a strategy and often asked her students to illustrate a section of a novel after she read aloud During one class period Mrs Martinez modeled how to visualize a scene she had just read aloud from The Cay Make a picture of what we just read Im going to go back and reread What is he seeing Luis A soldier Caroline A tall wall Mrs Martinez What is next to the wall Luis Ocean Mrs Martinez What is on top of the wall Victor Soldiers Mrs Martinez drew a picture on the smart board as she was talking Through the process of actively observing as Mrs Martinez visualized and illustrated students were able to imagine characters setting and events Researchers and practitioners have described visualization strategies that improve students reading comprehension Brinda Naughton Palmer et al Park Rozansky Aagesen Mrs Martinez described the reasons she taught students to visualize Students need to see what they are reading to comprehend The English language makes it difficult for some students who are still learning English During class Mrs Martinez said Make a picture in your brain while you are reading While Im reading to you make a movie in your head After she drew her own examples Mrs Martinez asked the students to illustrate a different scene in the book that they had read aloud in class Mentally imagining the scene students first illustrated the scene Next Mrs Martinez walked around the classroom asking students to explain their illustrations in English Although the students often struggled when reading the book individually they could refer back to their illustrations and explain how they visualized the plot and characters Likewise Park found that the students in her study were able to discuss their visualizations and come to higher levels of understanding about characters Theme Crossing cultural boundaries with Cuentos For Mrs Martinez telling stories or cuentos to illustrate a point or make a connection was essential to her teaching repertoire Using YAL in the classroom taught students the importance of storytelling and literature and Mrs Martinez often told stories to help students understand the literature and connect the literature to their personal lives Storytelling is an essential element of many family cultures and instruction using stories and storytelling to engage English language learners has been effectively documented Danzak Early Norton Graziano Cuentos helped students negotiate their hybrid identities of Mexican and Texan in Mrs Martinez language arts classroom Reading Improvement Through the storytelling process students connect literature in English with their own experiences in Mexico or within their family cultures Mrs Martinez use of personal examples from her own life and family made the literature come alive for the students Mrs Martinez explained If you dont make it real for them you wont have their attention Sharing similar cultural and family experiences allowed students to view Mrs Martinez as someone who had negotiated the borderlands throughout her life and career Going beyond connecting to students familiarity with Mexican culture Mrs Martinez often taught students information they may not have been brought up with unless they lived in Mexicofor example students were reading about ballad sellers in the novel The Whipping Boy Ballad sellers are like people who sung Mexican corridos Mrs Martinez explained Although she didnt explain some of the subversive purposes behind some corridos Mrs Martinez opened up a space for students to create their Mestizoa identities through a conversation about Mexican corridos and English ballads Some of Mrs Martinez students may experience a sense of loss for their Spanish language and heritage as they learn English Mrs Martinez modeling of bilingualism and cultural knowledge encouraged students to connect emotionally and academically with her teaching Sharing experiences about her family members in Mexico and in the US Mrs Martinez connected to her students by using personal examples and calling on students to share their personal experiences and knowledge Escamilla et al ELL students who are welcomed into the classroom with the assumption that they will improve literacy in both their native language and English usually demonstrate academic success Sullivan For some Latino students respect and care involve validating their language and cultural identity Garza Alejandro Blythe Fite Garza Valenzuela Encouraging higher levels of reading and writing Mrs Martinez engaged immigrant students in connecting experiences growing up in Mexico and in the local area with novels they read in class An emphasis on the benefits of academic success is essential for students to persist in schools In a class discussion on the book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry Mrs Martinez and the class talked about the characters emphasis on education Mrs Martinez See how Cassies family thinks school is important Alberto My cousins in Mexico dont go to school all dayâ€”they get out at noon Mrs Martinez Thats because they dont supply the places or food for lunch in Mexico so they have to go home to eat This conversation revealed how Mrs Martinez encouraged her students to think about the importance of education In connecting to the studentsfamilial and personal lives Mrs Martinez was able to help her students think about how they might develop academic identities Moll Ruiz suggest that the schooling of Latinos and African Americans can be analyzed together for they share similar political environments and colonial forms of education p In discussions about Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry a novel about an African America family Mrs Martinez may have intentionally or unintentionally built bridges between her Mexican and African American students The social and political powers at work on the education of African Americans during the depression were discussed during one class discussion Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands Mrs Martinez Why didnt Little Man want the book Laura Because it was old Mrs Martinez Yes and Caroline Because it said nigger in the book Mrs Martinez What did the teacher tell Cassie Carlos Thats what you are Laura Thats mean Mrs Martinez Yes it is Then what did Cassies mom do at home and why Raymond Her mom covered the books Carlos Because her mom understood why they were mad Thats why she covered the books Mrs Martinez Very good Cassie knew her mom understood In this discussion Ms Martinez encouraged the students to think about how Cassie and her family resisted the constraints put on them by the White community and the African American teachers whofeared the white people in power Another student Angela commented Thats not freedom if some students have to be in a different school than others In the end students were left to discern their own connections to contemporary schooling but encouraging sixth graders to become aware of institutions and how they may limit nonwhite peoples chances for education was an important understanding Although Mrs Martinez pushed students to practice speaking reading and writing English she was also sensitive of their reluctance to participate publicly using a second language that they were just learning In a conversation after class one day Mrs Martinez explained When they are English learners you have to give them the opportunity to speak English because they wont if you dont pressure them a bit they will find their comfort zone Sometimes we discuss things out loud and its ok if they copycat or piggyback on someone else as long as they are expressing what I need them to say in English These strategies encouraged ELL students to speak their native language and make mistakes without criticism from the teacher or peers Emphasizing that learning is a process Mrs Martinez provided a space for students to improve their language and literacy understanding through classroom practice and peer support Although Mrs Martinez appeared to place value on speaking English for academic purposes the students seemed to recognize that bilingualism opened up possibilities for them to compete in academic and workplace markets When the language and culture of the teacher tend to be similar to the students the differences across academic boundaries can be overcome more easily Bourdieu Grenfall Thus the students in Mrs Martinez class connected their own cultural and linguistic experiences with hers Theme Cultural contradictions in school borderlands Mrs Martinezs perceptions about the benefits of teaching YAL to ELLs occasionally conflicted with the school principals emphasis on comprehension skills in preparation for the state exams Although Mrs Martinez believed that YAL could engage students more effectively in learning English and improving literacy skills she also acquiesced to teaching with short passages and comprehension questions because the principal requested that all teachers focus on test preparation Reading Improvement In some cases schools serve as borders for teachers who must navigate testing administration and curricular guidelines even when they dont support such schoolenforced boundaries Gloria Anzaldua defines a borderland as a vague and undetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural boundary It is in a constant state of transition p Public schools are places that can encourage hybridity of cultures and language at the same time school environments may add to multicultural tensions that already exist In this section we interpret Mrs Martinez work as she negotiated cultural and linguistic borders with students and administrators In January the principal of Central Elementary expressed concern that the previous years test scores were too low Mrs Martinez was asked tofocus on teaching reading comprehension strategies using short nonfiction articles instead of teaching with YAL I dont like it but have to be obedient she explained During the next few months the first author changed her researcher role to a participantobserver as she worked with students in small groups during the testpreparation class sessions reading aloud with the students and practicing reading strategies such as questioning predicting and summarizing The texts were predominantly informational texts which worked well for teaching students comprehension and test taking strategies If a student seemed confused one of the students in the group would interpret in Spanish One student who translated for another student said I was like that last yearâ€”I wasnt very good at English This provided other students in the group with a sense of power realizing that like their peers they would eventually be able demonstrate proficiency in two languages Mrs Martinez intentionally formed groups in which students with limited English could partner with students who were more Englishproficient T his supports Fitts analysis of bilingual classrooms that were effective when fluent English speakers were paired with emerging bilingual students By April the students were performing well on nineweek reading comprehension tests so Mrs Martinez returned to reading YALwith the class Although teaching students reading comprehension strategies is necessary for academic success Mrs Martinez believed that studying literature and culture and helping students to become lifelong learners in both languages would provide students with linguistic and cultural power Teaching YAL allowed Mrs Martinez to share her cultural and linguistic experiences with her students while encouraging students to maintain bicultural and bilingual identities Haddix Mrs Martinez explained that students at Central Elementary were expected to transition out of ELL instruction by seventh grade The school district used to be early exitâ€”we would try to get the bilingual kids to exit in third grade and they said that there was a lot of failing and the kids would drop out So they wanted them to be strong in their language so we sixth grade become an exit and this is the first group of kids that got targeted with the program where they got more Spanish So I said let them test in Spanish and see how they do And they all did wonderful They all passed A lot of commended For native Spanish speakers taking the tests in Spanish provided them with educational and linguistic power However as Ruiz explains allowing students to speak their native language is not necessarily allowing them voice English is the language of the academically privileged and the students access to English is important for their academic success however the new mestijae must be multilingual able to speak English Teaching Literacy To English Language Learners In The Borderlands Spanish Spanglish TexMex and other language variations Anzaldua SaldivarHull Right before a holiday weekend on a day when parents pulled their children out of school I commented on the large number of absent students Mrs Martinez explained These kids here are the more recent immigrants Their parents want them to attend regularly to learn English Mrs Martinez explained that the children may become the language brokers or teachers of their parents who want to learn English RolonDow Valencia Valenzuela The deficit view of new immigrants and workingclass Latino households as lacking worthwhile knowledge and experiences is subverted in Mrs Martinez classroom in the literary connections and class discussions about family history culture and place Moll Ruis Valencia Conclusions and Im plications In analyzing our four themes we were reminded that not all public schools will be aware of or embrace students use of their native languages Garcia reminds us that teachers may need to defend an emphasis on bilingualism for their students After examining our themes through the lenses of borderlands and critical care we believe that Mrs Martinez cared about her students learning in both Spanish and English however pressure was placed on her to teach students English so they would be prepared for an Englishonly environment in their seventh grade year Theme I English Language Differentiation summed up Mrs Martinez methods of teaching English through the use of Spanish cognates At the same time she taught students the value of retaining their first language by encouraging them to speak in Spanish to ask questions and clarify information Martinez Valenzuela Theme Visualization and Reading comprehension demonstrated Mrs Martinez strategy of visualization for helping ELL students reading comprehension When Mrs Martinez modeled this visualization strategy with literature students learned to create pictures in their mind attaching English vocabulary to events and settings in YAL With practice Mrs Martinez believed they would not only acquire a new strategy but also improve their comprehension of English In our discussion of theme Crossing Boundaries with Cuentos we observed the importance of storytelling to culture and ELL learning Mrs Martinez valued YAL as a method for capturing her students interests and individuality Her personal stories about Mexico helped to connect to her students backgrounds and family cultures Our final theme Cultural Contradictions in School Borderlands captures the issues and problems that are at work in bilingual education Research that encourages students to use multiple languages during the process of learning is often at odds with school policies Garcia Johnson Seltzer Although the researchers were not aware of any policies against speaking Spanish or other first languages Mrs Martinez seemed to believe she must help the students transition to English to best prepare them for secondary school Mrs Martinez and other teachers of language minority students must create safe cultural spaces for their students to become successful in public schools Although not an easy task Moll recommends that schools capitalize on the cultural resources found in local communities to create stronger connections between schools and families We can help our preservice teachers through discussions about how teachers can create projects and assignments that include students families and cultures We observed Mrs Martinez teaching literacy and language through the lens of critical Reading Improvement care Her high expectations and personal connections with the students prepared students as much as possible for transition to junior high school where they may not receive support in Spanish Hopefully her students will find needed support through other means as they enter the next grade and continue to work on literacy and language skills However we realize that needed support is often missing or incomplete for English language learners Our hope is that teachers like Mrs Martinez will support their students as they construct academic cultural and linguistic identities Students identities in the borderlands are always in flux as they work toward learning English without losing their Spanish language and Chicanoa cultures Gloria Anzaldua asserts that the new Mestiza must adjust by becoming divergent thinkers and more inclusive of other ways of thinking People of all races and backgrounds can also embrace this idea by critiquing the programs and classes that promote English as the only language and assimilation as the way to exist in the US References
